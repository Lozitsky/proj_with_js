# Rock Paper Scissors

[Implementation](https://lozitsky.github.io/proj_with_js/module1/rock-paper-scissors/)

## Overview

Building a Rock Paper Scissors game from scratch

## Learning Goals

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- localStorage to persist data
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
