# Tic Tac Toe

[Implementation](https://lozitsky.github.io/proj_with_js/module1/tic-tac-toe/)

## Overview

Building a Tic Tac Toe game from scratch

## Learning Goals

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- localStorage to persist data
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo.html).
