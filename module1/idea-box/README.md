# IdeaBox

[Implementation](https://lozitsky.github.io/proj_with_js/module1/idea-box/)

## Overview

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, weâ€™ll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

## Learning Goals

- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using localStorage and JSON
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
